# Observus

> **One binary. Two missions. Total coverage.**  

## What is Observus?

Observus is a next-generation, dual-purpose adversary simulation C2 framework designed for full-spectrum security testing.

It empowers red teams to emulate sophisticated threat actors with realistic offensive operations â€” and equips blue teams to validate, tune, and enhance their detection and response capabilities in environments that mirror production realities.

More than just an offensive tool, Observus is a controlled adversary emulator with:
- Native, bi-directional SIEM integration enabling real-time telemetry exchange and detection feedback.
- A modular plugin system for rapid customization and extension tailored to evolving threats.
- An open-source, auditable codebase built for reliability, transparency, and operational safety.
- A lightweight, stealthy design engineered to run efficiently even in hardened environments.

Observus bridges the gap between attack simulation and defense validation â€” breaking down silos and empowering teams to work smarter and faster.
